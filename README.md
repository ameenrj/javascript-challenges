## JavaScript Challenges

### Description

This repo contains a collection of various JavaScript and SQL challenges. Using JavaScript, TypeScript, Jest.

### Assumptions

Question 2
- The right balance of performance and simplicity is required
    - Simplest solution would be to loop over O(n) times
    - Most performant solution would be to use the 'Divisor function' in mathematics/number theory

SQL Questions (Question 5-6)
- Using MySQL 8.0.12 is okay
- Column naming convention is PascalCase as in the spec (ColumnID vs column_id)

Question 8
- HTML input is given as a document element (if it was intended to be a string - one solution would be to first load the HTML into the document and return the links that way)
- External dependencies are not a problem
